1) Identify the names and format of the 3 biggest files. Can you come up with a command to generate a numerically ordered list of 3 biggest files?
(hint: consider using wc to gauge image size)

Firstly I placed the HW file in my workspace. To get the 3 largest files I wrote the following command " $wc -c * | sort -n | tail-n 4 > sortedpics.txt " the command
tells the shell to find the bytes for each picture, place them in ascending order, display the bottom three (highest bytes) and place the three in a new text file
called "sortedpics.txt". This is achieved by using the pipe call "|".

2) Some of the image files are empty, a sign of corruption. Can you find the empty photo files (0 kb size) , count them, and generate a list of their filenames to make 
their later replacement easier?

To find all pictures that are empty i wrote this command " $ find -size 0 > emptyfiles.txt " this commands finds all empty pictures and places them in a new txt 
file I created called emptyfiles.txt
